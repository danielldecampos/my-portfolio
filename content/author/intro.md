**Work Philosophy**  
â€¢ Automation isnâ€™t enough. What matters is understanding why something should be automated and for whom.  
â€¢ Infrastructure is part of the product. If itâ€™s not treated with the same care, everything else suffers.  
â€¢ Less is more. I prefer a simple, well understood solution over a complex one thatâ€™s hard to maintain.  
â€¢ Knowledge isnâ€™t private property. Documenting is sharing. Sharing is growth.
